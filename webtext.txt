About me
A little about me...

I'm inquisitive, energetic and fascinated with the possibilities of data collection and management.

I'm a senior at the University of South Carolina in Columbia majoring in computer science.  My experience
includes designing and developing Android applications in a team environment under strict deadlines, databases
to be implemented in academic and real world situations, and implementing multiple APIs to unify multiple 
systems. 

The majority of the enjoyment I get from being a computer scientist originates from being able to provide
solutions to ra variety of academic and real world situations. By incorporating multiple systems to include 
decision logic and database components, I've collaborated on a project that will assist the medical field by 
providing improved methods to assess and treat patients during mass casualty events. The benefits of this project 
include helping first responders  more efficiently analyze and determine patient aiglments during the most critical
scenarios. In the biology field, I desigined and implemented a relational database schema for the purpose of dissecting 
the Protein Data Bank into a finer grain to answer longstanding challenges in Structural Biology. Numerous
scientific questions can benefit from the parsing of the PDB, but the initial research is focused on examining 
the dihedral angles of consecutive amino acids. Due to the size of the data and the nature of the queries,
implementation of a big database management system might prove the only timily method to mine the data.



The work I've done has allowed me to continue to learn, grow as both a person and a computer scientist, and 
contribute multiple diciplines.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading (fiction, nonfiction, graphic novels), breaking coding projects, riding my
bike at the crack of dawn, and when all else fails, trying not to play too many video games.

Projects

Cindy's List

Description - An Android application designed to create and manage shopping lists. Design was influenced by
attempting to trigger the user's memory by providing a preloaded selection of items that can be added to
an individual's list. Each item in the list can have price, image, and upc associated to highten the user 
experience.

Current Status - Undergoing strict testing and receiving intense scrutiny. The application is 
capable of creating and editing multiple lists, providing a total for all the items, and keeping track of
items while shopping.  

Future Plans -  
	- Adding a server for uploading of data (upc, prices) dynamically based on the user's location
	- initial download of images to the stock database
	- Add/store recipes and be able to add all the items from the recipe into a shopping list
	- Sort lists by category/isles based on location
	- Share lists between multiple users


Advise Me

Description - A system that will assist college students through the majority of advising requirements.  
System was concieved due to the need at the University of South Carolina for proper advising.

Current Status - Currently in rough design phase.

Future Plans -Planned system capabilities include:
	Track student progress through degree curriculum
		Ensure students are aware of minimum grade requirements
		Track prerequisites 
		Suggest classes that should be completed per year/semester
	Provide alerts for withdrawal/drop dates and registration times
	Provide students and advisors with a simple system for advisement/registration
		Set up appointments
		Approval of schedules
	Notify students of important dates, milestones, and requirements
		Senior checks
		Financial Aide reminders
	Track required class availability
