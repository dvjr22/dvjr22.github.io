About me
A little about me...

I'm an inquisitive, energetic computer scientist with a passion for data collection/management and software
design.

I'm a senior at the University of South Carolina in Columbia majoring in computer science.  My experience
includes designing and developing Android applications in a team environment under strict deadlines, databases
to be implemented in academic and real world situations, and incorporating multiple computer aspects to create
a unified system to solve and prevent problems.

What I most enjoy about the technology field is having the opportunity to be part of providing solutions to
current problems.  The work I've been a part of will be used to make improvements in the medical field with 
the assessment and treatment of patients, and in the biology field, examining relationships between proteins
and exploring the new possibilities from the discoveries.  The work I've done has allowed me to continue to 
learn, grow as both a person and a computer scientist, and possibly contribute multiple diciplines.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading(fiction, nonfiction, graphic novels), and trying not to play too many video
games.

Projects

Cindy's List

Description - An Android application designed to create and manage shopping lists. Design was influenced by
attempting to trigger the user's memory by providing a preloaded selection of items that can be added to
an individual's list. Each item in the list can have price, image, and upc associated to highten the user 
experience.

Current Status - Undergoing strict testing and receiving intense scrutiny. The application is 
capable of creating and editing multiple lists, providing a total for all the items, and keeping track of
items while shopping.  

Future Plans -  
	- Adding a server for uploading of data (upc, prices) dynamically based on the user's location
	- initial download of images to the stock database
	- Add/store recipes and be able to add all the items from the recipe into a shopping list
	- Sort lists by category/isles based on location
	- Share lists between multiple users


Advise Me

Description - A system that will assist college students through the majority of advising requirements.  
System was concieved due to the need at the University of South Carolina for proper advising.

Current Status - Currently in rough design phase.

Future Plans -Planned system capabilities include:
	Track student progress through degree curriculum
		Ensure students are aware of minimum grade requirements
		Track prerequisites 
		Suggest classes that should be completed per year/semester
	Provide alerts for withdrawal/drop dates and registration times
	Provide students and advisors with a simple system for advisement/registration
		Set up appointments
		Approval of schedules
	Notify students of important dates, milestones, and requirements
		Senior checks
		Financial Aide reminders
